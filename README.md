# leaflet-challenge

For this assignment, an earthquake data set was imported from United States Geological Survey (USGS), then used to create a map using Leaflet that plots all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.

On the map created:
- data markers were included to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and colour. (Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in colour.)
- popups were included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- a legend was included to provide context.
- light 'street' map and dark map options are available.
- earthquake markers can be toggled on and off.
